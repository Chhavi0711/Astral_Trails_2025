# Astral_Trails_2025
Resources for Astral Trails, Summer Project'25, Astronomy Club, IIT Kanpur, are uploaded here.

### Description
This project will explore cosmic rays-high-energy particles from space-and investigate their biological and technological impacts. Students will:
- Build a DIY cloud chamber to visualize cosmic ray interactions.
- Capture and analyze cosmic ray trails using image processing and computational models.
- Investigate how cosmic rays cause mutations in DNA and their implications for astronaut health and space exploration.

Deliverable:
Functional cloud chamber, cosmic ray visualization data, rule-based track cosmic ray classification model, computational DNA damage analysis
